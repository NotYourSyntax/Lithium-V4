This is the premium version of Lithium-V2 and its one kf the best nuker on the cord.

## Support
There is no more support for this. This is going open-sourced, so you can do it yourself to how you want.

## Pull Requests
Feel free to submit pull requests

## Release Reason
The reason Lithium is going public is because I believe that the nuking community is pure cancer, not in the sense of toxicity, but in the amount of skids. The average IQ of the nuking community is at about tiktok liberal levels. So fuck skids, I'm dippin.
